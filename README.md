Java Web Crawler!

There are two main goals for this project: 
- More practice programming
- Generate a map of a website and crawl it. Currently (April 2022) thinking of a few possibilities:
      - Create an image mapping the website
      - Show any associations (server host, server info, users listed, names, etc) in an organized, human readable fashion
      - SPEED!
      - will see how this goes and add more ideas if necessary, or remove things if unnecessary
